Develop a Java application to find the effective resistance, inductance, and capacitance of parallel series combination of resistor, inductor, and capacitors.
Create a class Resistor with the following 
Data member: resistance, 
Members functions: readValue, printValue, parallel, series, and constructors.

Create a class Inductor with the following 
Data member: inductance, 
Members functions: readValue, printValue, parallel, series, and constructors.

Create a class Capacitor with the following 
Data member: capacitance,
Members functions: readValue, printValue, parallel, series, and constructors.

Create a class Calculation1 with static member function: main and calculate the parallel series combinations of resistor, inductor, capacitors and display the result.
